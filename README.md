Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub page, where I'll be showcasing my Data Wrangling projects completed during my Udacity journey. I'm excited to share my experience and the valuable skills I've gained in gathering, assessing, and cleaning messy data for analysis and visualization.

## Course Overview

Throughout the Udacity Data Wrangling course, I've been on an exciting learning adventure, discovering the ins and outs of data wrangling. Here's an overview of what I've covered:

1. **Introduction to Data Wrangling:** I delved into the fundamentals of data wrangling, understanding why it's a crucial step in the data analysis process. I learned about different types of data issues and the overall data wrangling workflow.

2. **Data Gathering Techniques:** I explored various data gathering methods and tools, including web scraping, APIs, and databases. Learning how to collect data from different sources was eye-opening.

3. **Data Assessment:** I discovered techniques to assess data for quality and tidiness, identifying and documenting data issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies.

4. **Data Cleaning:** Mastering data cleaning techniques using pandas in Python was both challenging and rewarding. I now know how to handle missing data, address duplicates, correct inaccuracies, and restructure data for analysis.

5. **Advanced Data Wrangling:** I tackled more complex data wrangling tasks, such as dealing with text data, parsing dates, and handling JSON and XML formats.

6. **Real-world Projects:** Throughout the course, I worked on practical projects involving real-world datasets, allowing me to apply my data wrangling skills in different scenarios.

## My Projects

On this GitHub page, you'll find the projects I completed as part of the Data Wrangling course. I've included detailed explanations, code, and visualizations to showcase the process and the insights gained from each project.

Feel free to explore the repositories and check out the data wrangling techniques I applied to various datasets. Your feedback and suggestions are always welcome!

## Prerequisites

Before taking this course, I had some basic knowledge of Python programming and familiarity with data concepts like variables and data types. The course material and hands-on exercises helped me build on this foundation and dive deeper into the world of data wrangling.
